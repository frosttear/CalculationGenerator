# Calculation Practice Pages

## Introduction

This project provides a collection of web-based practice pages designed to help children improve their arithmetic and unit conversion skills. The pages are built with HTML, CSS, and Vue.js, and they generate a variety of exercises dynamically.

You can access the practice pages here: [https://frosttear.github.io/CalculationGenerator/](https://frosttear.github.io/CalculationGenerator/)

## Features

*   **Central Hub:** An `index.html` page provides easy navigation to all practice modules.
*   **Variety of Exercises:**
    *   Basic addition and subtraction within 10.
    *   Customizable arithmetic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with configurable number ranges and complexity.
    *   Vertical addition and subtraction problems.
    *   Specialized two-digit multiplication and division practice with educational constraints.
    *   Unit conversion exercises for Chinese RMB (Yuan, Jiao, Fen) and time (Hours, Minutes, Seconds).
*   **Interactive and Printable:** The pages are designed to be used interactively in the browser or printed for offline practice.
*   **Minesweeper Game:** A classic Minesweeper game is included for fun and to practice logical thinking.

## Available Practice Pages

All pages can be accessed from the main [`docs/index.html`](./docs/index.html) page.

*   **[Basic Calculation](./docs/BasicCalculation.html):** Generates simple addition and subtraction problems for numbers within 10.
*   **[Calculation Generator](./docs/CalculationGenerator.html):** A flexible generator for creating practice sheets with a mix of operators (+, -, ×, ÷), configurable number ranges, and problems with up to three numbers.
*   **[Tens Addition and Subtraction Practice](./docs/TensAdditionSubtraction.html):** Practice addition and subtraction with multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, etc.).
*   **[Vertical Equations](./docs/VerticalEquations.html):** Focuses on two-digit vertical (columnar) addition and subtraction.
*   **[Two-Digit × One-Digit Practice](./docs/TwoDigitMultiplication.html):** Specialized multiplication practice with constraints (ones digit product < 10, result < 100)
