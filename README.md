# Calculation Practice Pages

## Introduction

This project provides a collection of web-based practice pages designed to help children improve their arithmetic and unit conversion skills. The pages are built with HTML, CSS, and Vue.js, and they generate a variety of exercises dynamically.

You can access the practice pages here: [https://frosttear.github.io/CalculationGenerator/](https://frosttear.github.io/CalculationGenerator/)

## Features

*   **Central Hub:** An `index.html` page provides easy navigation to all practice modules.
*   **Variety of Exercises:**
    *   Basic addition and subtraction within 10.
    *   Customizable arithmetic problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with configurable number ranges and complexity.
    *   Vertical addition and subtraction problems.
    *   Specialized two-digit multiplication and division practice with educational constraints.
    *   Unit conversion exercises for Chinese RMB (Yuan, Jiao, Fen) and time (Hours, Minutes, Seconds).
*   **Interactive and Printable:** The pages are designed to be used interactively in the browser or printed for offline practice.
*   **Minesweeper Game:** A classic Minesweeper game is included for fun and to practice logical thinking.

## Available Practice Pages
